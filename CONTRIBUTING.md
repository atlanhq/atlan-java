# Rules for Contributing

We welcome contributions to the project.

When contributing to the code, each developer must include a sign-off statement in the commit message indicating that the code being contributed is the author's original work or that they otherwise have all permissions to commit that work to this open source project.

To keep this simple, you can do this by including a Sign-off-by line in each of your commits:

```
Signed-off-by: Jane Doe <jane.doe@example.com>
```

**By signing your work, you are confirming that the origin of the content makes it suitable to add to this project (that it adheres to the [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://developercertificate.org)).**

You can include such signed-off-by lines automatically when you commit a change to your local git repository using:

```
git commit -s
```
